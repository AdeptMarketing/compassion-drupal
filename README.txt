not404gotten
============

404gotten.org is a site developed by Compassion to help impoverished children around the world receive sponsorships by replacing a traditional 404 page with one that provides the details of a child in need. The 404 page provides a photograph of the child, country and sponsorship link.

Our plugin allows Drupal site owners to embed our 404 page. An example of the page that will be rendered can be viewed here: http://404gotten.org/foundframe/
